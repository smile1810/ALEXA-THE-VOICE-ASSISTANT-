**PROBLEM STATEMENT**
 
Develop a simple, always-listening voice assistant in Python (similar to Amazon 
Alexa) that can understand basic voice commands spoken in English and 
perform the following actions without requiring any commercial APIs or paid 
services: - Recognize the wake word “Alexa” and ignore speech that does not contain it.   - Play any song on YouTube when the user says “Alexa play [song name]”.   - Tell the current time when asked “Alexa what’s the time”.   - Provide a brief description of a person or topic from Wikipedia when the user 
asks “Alexa who is [name]”.   - Tell a joke when the user says “Alexa tell me a joke”.   - Respond with humorous predefined replies to personal questions like “Are you 
single?” or “Date?”.   - Work on Windows, macOS, and Linux with minimal setup, using free and 
open-source or freely available libraries only.   - Use offline text-to-speech so the assistant can speak even without an internet 
connection (while accepting that speech recognition and some features need 
internet). 
The solution must be beginner-friendly, run in an infinite loop until manually 
stopped, include basic error handling, and require only a working microphone 
and speakers/headphones. 


**SCOPE OF THE PROJECT**
 
Basic "Alexa"-activated voice assistant in Python. 
Can play YouTube songs, tell time, read Wikipedia summaries, tell jokes, 
and give funny replies. 
Uses Google STT (needs internet), offline TTS, and simple keyword 
matching. 
Runs forever in console, works on Windows/macOS/Linux. 
Great for learning — not a full-featured assistant. No advanced features, no 
offline speech recognition, English only. 


**TARGET USERS**
 
1.) Beginner Python learners wanting a fun, working voice assistant 
project 

2.)Students & hobbyists exploring speech recognition and 
text-to-speech 

3.)Coding tutorial followers (YouTube, blogs, bootcamps) looking for a 
complete, runnable example 

4.)Makers/tinkerers who want a quick base to modify and add their own 
commands 

5.)Educators/teachers using it as a classroom demo for automation and 
APIs 

Perfect for anyone who knows basic Python and wants an impressive 
weekend project — not for end-users seeking a serious daily assistant.
